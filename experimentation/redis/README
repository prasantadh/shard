Make sure the guest kernel is running using the appropriate redis command in ${SHARD_PATH}/shard_monitor/qemu/run_qemu

Everything below has to be done on the guest :

	install the appropriate redis version on the guest machine
	Disable redis from running at start-up
		sudo service disable redis-server
	redis-server --daemonize yes
	now copy server/redis_cli.sh to server and run
	./redis_cli.sh


Now nginx is running on guest. Everything below has to be done on host:
	run each of the tests  in run_redis_tests.sh one by one. Running them together causes kernel to hang.

	For each run, the time taken to complete will be reported.
