Make sure the guest kernel is running using the appropriate nginx command in ${SHARD_PATH}/shard_monitor/qemu/run_qemu

Everything below has to be done on the guest :

	install the appropriate nginx version on the guest machine
	Disable nginx from running at start-up
		sudo service disable nginx
	mkdir nginx
	{Copy contents of server to nginx directory}
	Create files of size 2kb - 128kb in nginx/root on the guest
	copy server/default to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default on the guests

	Now run nginx by bash nginx/run_nginx


Now nginx is running on guest. Everything below has to be done on host:
	./run_all_tests.sh

	This will run the client/ab_script 10 times for each file size and report the median
