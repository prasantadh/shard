## Instrumentation for SHARD-protected kernels

This directory contains all the code needed for instrumented SHARD kernels (Linux)
which are used for analysis and run-time.

Prerequisites - gclang (see /kernelguard/pre-req.sh)
                LLVM-5 (present at /kernelguard/llvm-5.0. Build by following instructions)

1) Follow the instructions in `kernel-bitcode` to clone the github repo, and
   generate the vmlinux and LLVM bitcode

2) Follow the instructions in callgraph to create the static callgraph

3) Add the instrumentation that you want to make
	- Follow the instructions in profiling-kernel to generate a kernel for profiling
	- Follow the instructions in protected-kernel to generate a kernel for run-time

4) Follow the instructions in build_shard_runtime_deps to build all the dependencies needed by SHARD
	Copy all these dependencies into arch/x86/kvm/. of your host kernel.
